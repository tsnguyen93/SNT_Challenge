This is simple PHP web application that will parse through 
the CNN article http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/16/design/nasa-mars-posters/index.html

It will grab the head, main image, and the story.

 
The story has been stripped of all html tags and is being displayed in plain text.
I used break points after each line so it's easy to read.
